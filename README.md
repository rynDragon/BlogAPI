# Welcome to BlogAPI
This project will be feature complete when it reaches the point where it exposes a sufficient number of endpoint to provide useful functionality to create, retrieve, and update records between a MongoDB Collection and client. The client will be in development, but will remain a separate project.
# Not Quite a full MEAN stack
What is included here:
- **M**ongoDB
- **E**xpress
- **N**ode

The project here is just going to focus on the endpoints and handling requests. A separate project will handle making it user-friendly. I'm quite content to test it in Postman!

# What is left
- [x] Expose a number of endpoints
- [ ] Implement Authorization and Authentication
- [ ] Enjoy a celebratory coffee
